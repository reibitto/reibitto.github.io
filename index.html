        <h2>Getting to the bottom of Pikachu's boobs</h2>

        <p>
            Many Pokemon fans may already be familiar with the often cited story that when Pokemon was first pitched to
            be localized in the US, the American staff proposed replacement designs for Pikachu because they thought
            Pikachu was "too cute" for the American market. Supposedly they suggested turning Pikachu into "a tiger with
            huge breasts" as they thought this would appeal more to American kids.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon reading this for the first time, I thought to myself, "There's absolutely no way this could be true".
            However, when I followed the source (from this <a href="https://youtu.be/yheM8RqvqFQ">Did You Know
            Gaming?</a> YouTube
            video), to my surprise it was Tsunekazu Ishihara, president of The Pokemon Company, who said this. And I did
            confirm that the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html">original Japanese
            interview</a> was <em>not</em> mistranslated (other than potentially translating an implicit "we" as "I").
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The first time we showed off some Pokémon in the US, we were told they were 'too cute'. The staff in
                America submitted their ideas for replacement designs, but we just couldn't believe the kind of stuff
                they were proposing.</p>

            <p>"They turned Pikachu into something like a tiger with huge breasts. It looked like a character from the
                musical Cats. When I asked 'how is this supposed to be Pikachu??' they said, 'Well look, there's its
                tail right there'... Seriously, that was the kind of stuff being proposed.</p>

        <p>"How could this be!?", I thought to myself. The story makes no sense, yet here it is straight from the
            president's mouth.</p>

        <p>I did some more digging as I wasn't ready to accept this. I found 2 old interviews from Satoru Iwata, from
            2008 and 2009 respectively where he clearly states that the Pikachu redesign they received was a large
            <em>muscular</em> Pikachu, not "a tiger with huge breasts" like the musical <em>Cats</em>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>They saw Pocket Monsters and said, "Creatures this cute can't be called 'monsters'. A monster needs to
                muscular and more fearsome." When I received their muscular Pikachu redesign I thought to myself,
                "There's no way we can show this to the people who created Pokemon". I remember this like it was
                yesterday, even though about 10 years have passed since then.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>When we were looking to expand Pokemon overseas, I can't forget what we were told. They said, "Something
                this
                cute can't be called a 'monster'". They said if you want success in the American market you need to go
                with a muscular redesign, such as the one they sent us.</p>

            <p>The president of Nintendo at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi, told me, "If there is no example [of a cute
                design like this] working in America, that's even more reason to give it a try. When it comes to
                entertainment, there is value to standing out from the rest. If something is unique and sees success, it
                has the potential to become really big. Go with the Japanese designs as is."</p>

            So what's going on? How are two official sources published by Nintendo on their own website disagreeing with
            one another?
        </p>

        <p>
            The answer likely lies in the Japanese word 胸, which can mean both chest or breasts/boobs. What appears to
            have happened is that the phrase "big chest" got misinterpreted on the Japanese side first. Iwata meant "big
            chest" as in large pectoral muscles, but somewhere down the line in retelling the story this turned into
            "huge boobs", like a bad game of telephone.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm inclined to believe Satoru Iwata's telling of the story as he appears to be the primary source. And the
            fact that he specifically says "even today I remember their words vividly" and "How am I supposed to show
            these redesigns to the people who created Pokemon?". So it stands to reason a lot of the creators of Pokemon
            didn't actually see the proposed redesigns and all their information is second-hand, hence why the details
            are different. In the following <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/ds/pokemon/0/2">Iwata
            Asks</a>, it
            is stated that Game Freak was busy with the development of Pokemon Gold and Silver, and that Nintendo along
            with Iwata (who didn't work for Nintendo at the time but was the go-between for the two) were the ones doing
            the work to bring Pokemon overseas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Between Iwata's words and the fact that it's not believable at all that Americans (who have always been
            sensitive about sexual imagery, especially in the 90s) would suggest such a change for a kid's show. When
            you consider cartoons airing at the time like <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> and <em>Street
            Sharks</em>, it's not
            difficult to imagine exactly what they were proposing for Pikachu's redesign.
