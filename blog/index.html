        <h2>Remote caching with sbt and S3 across multiple machines</h2>

        <div class="date-written">2022-7-11</div>
        <div class="tag">Scala</div>
        <div class="tag">sbt</div>

        <p>
            sbt 1.4.x introduced <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Remote-Caching.html">remote caching</a>, a
            feature for sharing your build output in order to save time during compilation. You can think of it
            similarly
            to how incremental compilation works in that if you change 1 file of a project containing hundreds of files,
            you'd
            rather not have to recompile <em>everything</em>. Remote caching takes this one step further. Rather than be
            limited to your machine, you can do this across multiple machines (or multiple branches on your local
            machine or what have you).
        </p>

        <p>
            sbt's remote caching feature is technically still marked experimental, but we've been using it at work for
            over a
            year
            now and haven't run into issues so far. We originally only set up this feature in CI (in our case Jenkins)
            but
            recently I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice to also re-use Jenkins' build output on my local machine
            too so
            that I never have to do a full recompile on this project ever again?" Considering the project in question is
            300,000+ LOC and takes roughly 7 minutes to perform a clean build on my underpowered laptop, I figured this
            would be a huge win. And spoilers... it was! ðŸ˜„ Now onto the setup:
        </p>

        <h2>Choosing the storage method</h2>

        <p>You have many options as to where to store the build cache. sbt can cache via Maven repository, so anywhere
            you can host a Maven repository is an option. That means a private <a
                    href="https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3">Nexus
                repository</a> would also work. In fact, <a href="https://www.muki.rocks/sbt-remote-cache-recipes/">here's
                a blog post from Muki Seiler which
                goes into that</a> (as well as using <a href="https://min.io/">minio</a> as an alternative).</p>

        <p>In our case, we didn't already have a private Nexus repository, nor were we too keen on setting one up as
            that
            meant needing another server running 24/7. We decided to try S3 instead, as it would mean less
            infrastructure to
            set
            up as well as being less costly.</p>

        <h2>The setup</h2>

        <p>
            Luckily there already exists an sbt plugin for resolving and publishing artifacts using S3 called <a
                href="https://github.com/tpunder/fm-sbt-s3-resolver">fm-sbt-s3-resolver</a>. Simply add the following to
            your <code>plugins.sbt</code> (or wherever you store it):</p>

        <pre class="codeblock"><code class="block">addSbtPlugin("com.frugalmechanic" % "fm-sbt-s3-resolver" % "0.20.0")</code></pre>

        <p>
            Then create an S3 bucket where you intend to store the build cache. For example, let's call the bucket
            <code>sbt_build_cache</code>.
        </p>

        <p>Once that's done, you can set the <code>pushRemoteCacheTo</code> sbt setting in your build file like so:</p>

        <pre class="codeblock"><code class="block">pushRemoteCacheTo := Some("S3 Remote Cache" at "s3://your-s3-bucket/sbt_build_cache/")</code></pre>

        <p>
            Note that it's called <code>pushRemoteCacheTo</code> but this works in both directions (push and pull).
            There is no
            <code>pullRemoteCacheFrom</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Credentials for S3</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tpunder/fm-sbt-s3-resolver#s3-credentials">fm-sbt-s3-resolver has a section
                about
                credentials</a> but personally I didn't see the need for any of that. The default
            <code>AWSCredentialsProvider</code>
            should already do everything you need. For your local machine, just make sure you've already configured your
            credentials file (the one usually located at <code>~/.aws/credentials</code>). In my case, I already had
            done this a
            long
            time ago which meant I didn't need to do anything else, but if you've never done it before <a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html">follow the steps
            described
            here</a>.</p>

        <p>Similarly, our Jenkins instance was basically already configured as it runs on
            ec2 and has an AWS role attached to it that can access the S3 bucket. The default <code>AWSCredentialsProvider</code>
            takes it from there and will perform the auth. If you haven't done this before, <a
                    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">the
                following article may be helpful</a>.</p>

        <p>And that's it. No need to set up a shared account or commit anything extra to the repository. Each developer
            should have their own AWS account that can be managed (and revoked) separately that accesses the S3
            bucket.</p>

        <p>
            While I've not tried this with GitHub Actions, I imagine the easiest solution would be to use the <a
                href="https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials"> configure-aws-credentials
        </a> action and follow the instructions described there.</p>

        <h3>Actual usage</h3>

        <p>
            In CI, when running your sbt command be sure to include the <code>pullRemoteCache</code> and <code>pushRemoteCache</code>
            tasks.
            Something like <code>pullRemoteCache; Test/compile; pushRemoteCache; test</code> or however you'd prefer to
            order the
            tasks
            (such as pushing the remote cache only <em>after</em> your tests have passed).
        </p>

        <p>
            As for usage on my local machine, I simply call <code>pullRemoteCache</code> followed by a
            <code>Test/compile</code> in sbt. What was
            once 7
            minutes to compile everything now takes 15 seconds. Almost all that time is spent downloading the artifacts.
            The compile step itself takes 2 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note the download from S3 only happens once per content hash. The artifacts are stored in your local sbt
            cache after
            the first download. So if you do another <code>clean</code> followed by a <code>pullRemoteCache</code>,
            it'll be much
            faster the second time.
        </p>

        <h2>The tricky parts</h2>

        <p>
            Everything up to this point went smoothly for me. As I mentioned earlier, we've been using sbt remote
            caching
            for over a year now in CI. The difference this time is that our local machines use a different environment
            from
            Jenkins. So when I pulled the remote cache from S3 (that Jenkins had uploaded) onto my Windows dev machine, I
            ran into
            unforeseen
            issues. While the <code>pullRemoteCache</code> task worked fine, whenever I went to compile anything it
            would do a full
            recompile each time.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I later realized is that all the cache files were getting invalidated by sbt/Zinc during the
            incremental compilation step. The
            reason was that what was being passed into <code>scalacOptions</code> differed slightly between my machine
            and Jenkins.
            For
            example, if my machine uses a <code>-Ybackend-parallelism</code> value of 16 while Jenkins uses 4, then Zinc
            will
            invalidate all the files and recompile everything.</p>

        <p>An even worse example is that on Windows the plugin paths are
            sent
            as <code>-Xplugin:target\compiler_plugins\wartremover_2.13.8-3.0.5.jar</code> and not
            <code>-Xplugin:target/compiler_plugins/wartremover_2.13.8-3.0.5.jar</code>. The backslash difference is
            enough to cause
            everything to get invalidated.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a workaround I did the following:
        </p>

        <pre class="codeblock"><code class="block">incOptions := incOptions.value
  .withIgnoredScalacOptions(
    incOptions.value.ignoredScalacOptions ++ Array(
      "-Xplugin:.*",
      "-Ybackend-parallelism [\\d]+"
    )
  )</code></pre>

        <p>
            Luckily this fixed it and everything works fine now.
        </p>

        <p>
            It took me a while to find but if you're struggling with similar issues, use the following options to
            enable the logs for debugging purposes:
        </p>


        <pre class="codeblock"><code class="block">logLevel := Level.Debug
incOptions := incOptions.value.withApiDebug(true)
</code></pre>

        <p>
            You'll be able to see what is causing invalidation to happen. Beware though, the logs are noisy. You may
            want to pipe it to a file.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional thoughts</h2>

        <p>
            Consider adding an expiration policy to your S3 bucket so that these cache files don't accumulate forever.
            We
            arbitrarily went with a 2 week lifetime, but use whatever value you think makes sense.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for sbt's incremental compilation options, I feel like it should be more aware of which scalac options
            are "safe" (i.e. don't ruin repeatable builds) and which are unsafe. Right now it seems way too aggressive to me as <em>any</em>
            difference will
            cause an invalidation. At the very least it should normalize paths. But perhaps this was never a concern
            before
            the remote caching feature was introduced. Maybe it's something that makes sense to address now.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            And that's it! I hope that was helpful and you're able to get remote caching working. It's definitely worth
            it
            for large projects. Surprisingly I rarely see this feature mentioned, and that's a shame because it's been
            tremendously helpful for cutting down our CI times. And now with local compilation too!
        </p>

        <p>
            Many Pokemon fans may already be familiar with the often cited story that when Pokemon was first pitched to
            be localized in the US, the American staff proposed replacement designs for Pikachu because they thought
            Pikachu was "too cute" for the American market. Supposedly they suggested turning Pikachu into "a tiger with
            huge breasts" as they thought this would appeal more to American kids.
        </p>

        <p>
            Upon reading this for the first time, I thought to myself, "There's absolutely no way this could be true".
            However, when I followed the source (from this <a href="https://youtu.be/yheM8RqvqFQ">Did You Know
            Gaming?</a> YouTube
            video), to my surprise it was Tsunekazu Ishihara, president of The Pokemon Company, who said this. And I did
            confirm that the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html">original Japanese
            interview</a> was <em>not</em> mistranslated (other than potentially translating an implicit "we" as "I").
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The first time we showed off some PokÃ©mon in the US, we were told they were 'too cute'. The staff in
                America submitted their ideas for replacement designs, but we just couldn't believe the kind of stuff
                they were proposing.</p>

            <p>"They turned Pikachu into something like a tiger with huge breasts. It looked like a character from the
                musical Cats. When I asked 'how is this supposed to be Pikachu??' they said, 'Well look, there's its
                tail right there'... Seriously, that was the kind of stuff being proposed.</p>

            <p class="source"><a href="https://youtu.be/yheM8RqvqFQ">Source (2020/7/9): Did You Know Gaming?</a></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>"How could this be!?", I thought to myself. The story makes no sense, yet here it is straight from the
            president's mouth.</p>

        <p>I did some more digging as I wasn't ready to accept this. I found 2 old interviews from Satoru Iwata, from
            2008 and 2009 respectively where he clearly states that the Pikachu redesign they received was a large
            <em>muscular</em> Pikachu, not "a tiger with huge breasts" like the musical <em>Cats</em>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>They saw Pocket Monsters and said, "Creatures this cute can't be called 'monsters'. A monster needs to
                muscular and more fearsome." When I received their muscular Pikachu redesign I thought to myself,
                "There's no way we can show this to the people who created Pokemon". I remember this like it was
                yesterday, even though about 10 years have passed since then.</p>

            <p class="source"><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/events/081031qa/03.html">Source (2008/10/31):
                Nintendo
                Official Website</a></p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>When we were looking to expand Pokemon overseas, I can't forget what we were told. They said, "Something
                this
                cute can't be called a 'monster'". They said if you want success in the American market you need to go
                with a muscular redesign, such as the one they sent us.</p>

            <p>The president of Nintendo at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi, told me, "If there is no example [of a cute
                design like this] working in America, that's even more reason to give it a try. When it comes to
                entertainment, there is value to standing out from the rest. If something is unique and sees success, it
                has the potential to become really big. Go with the Japanese designs as is."</p>

            <p class="source"><a href="https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/10311?page=2">Source (2009/5/18): Toyokeizai
                Online</a></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            So what's going on? How are two official sources published by Nintendo on their own website disagreeing with
            one another?
        </p>

        <p>
            The answer likely lies in the Japanese word èƒ¸, which can mean both chest or breasts/boobs. What appears to
            have happened is that the phrase "big chest" got misinterpreted on the Japanese side first. Iwata meant "big
            chest" as in large pectoral muscles, but somewhere down the line in retelling the story this turned into
            "huge boobs", like a bad game of telephone.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm inclined to believe Satoru Iwata's telling of the story as he appears to be the primary source. And the
            fact that he specifically says "even today I remember their words vividly" and "How am I supposed to show
            these redesigns to the people who created Pokemon?". So it stands to reason a lot of the creators of Pokemon
            didn't actually see the proposed redesigns and all their information is second-hand, hence why the details
            are different. In the following <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/ds/pokemon/0/2">Iwata
            Asks</a>, it
            is stated that Game Freak was busy with the development of Pokemon Gold and Silver, and that Nintendo along
            with Iwata (who didn't work for Nintendo at the time but was the go-between for the two) were the ones doing
            the work to bring Pokemon overseas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Between Iwata's words and the fact that it's not believable at all that Americans (who have always been
            sensitive about sexual imagery, especially in the 90s) would suggest such a change for a kid's show. When
            you consider cartoons airing at the time like <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> and <em>Street
            Sharks</em>, it's not
            difficult to imagine exactly what they were proposing for Pikachu's redesign.
